The United Nations Space Command (UNSC) is an agency of the Unified Earth Government.
It represents humanity's military and exploratory presence in space, defends Earth and its colonies, and briefly served as its emergency military government.
The UNSC conceived the Spartan super-soldier programmes which created the Master Chief, the protagonist of the Halo shooters.
As Earth's representatives in space, they're the protagonists of the Halo fiction (to call them 'good guys' is a bit strong, given the ethics they sometimes bend - see the Spartan programmes as a good example).
In Halo Wars 2's campaign, you'll play as a commander of the Spirit of Fire, a UNSC colony ship refitted for military purposes, with enough crew and supplies to maintain an army. James Cutter is the ship's captain, and the closest Halo Wars 2 has to a lead character.

The Banished are a splinter faction from perennial Halo villains, the Covenant. Their leader is Atriox, a chieftain of the alien species called Brutes (or Jiralhanae, to be accurate). Unconvinced by the Covenant’s religious mission and the war against humanity that it inspired, Atriox came to hate his masters for sending his people to their deaths in a conflict he saw as unnecessary. After surviving an assassination attempt that was his punishment for refusing orders, Atriox led a rebellion against the Covenant.
This was relatively early early in the war against humanity, before the Covenant was racked by a civil war known as the Great Schism. Shattered by these events and exhausted by the war, the Covenant disintegrates in the later Halo games. Atriox and his new faction - the Banished - manage to salvage much of their former power.
At some point before or during the events of Halo 5: Guardians, Atriox developed an interest in Installation 00, also called the Ark. Built by the ancient alien race known as the Forerunners, the Ark was the birthplace of the eponymous Halo rings, and Atriox learned it was also capable of ‘firing’ them. This would give him the power to wipe out life in the galaxy, if he wished.
Having consolidated the remnants of the Covenant, Atriox’s main motivation is the acquisition of power, so the Ark became his next destination. Upon arrival, the Banished destroyed the UNSC Ark Research Outpost, killing all the humans there but for Isabel, an AI.
